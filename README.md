The System requires the user to either input the City they want to check the weaher or click the, "Check Device Location" button to check the weather.

If the user selected the "Check Device Location" button, the system will ask the user to allow it to check its location. If the user allows this, the system will check for the devices current location and display the weather.
If the user denies this, the system will post an error message saying, "User denied Geolocation".

Then if the user is to enter a City name and then press the Enter key, the system will display the weather at said location. If the location is invalid, the system will display, "*City Name* isn't a valid city name".
